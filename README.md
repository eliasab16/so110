## Grippers

### 1. Parallel Gripper

The following gripper is a modified version of the base gripper that was designed by @norma-core (for full design and details: <https://github.com/norma-core/norma-core/blob/main/hardware/pgripper/README.md>).

This version includes several design modifications:

* Changed the shape, size, and length of the jaws to better handle small objects. The grasping point was also elevated closer to the camera for improved visibility.

* Added a mounting point on the gripper's base to support a bottom camera.

* Added notches on the inside of the jaws to support mouting arcs that can be used to grasp cylinderical tools (e.g. screw driver). See the "attachments" section.
